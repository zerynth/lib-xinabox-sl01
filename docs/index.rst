XinaBox SL01
*************

The SL01 xChip is a UV radiation and ambient light level sensor. It is based on the `VEML6075 <https://www.vishay.com/ppg?84304>`_ and `TSL4531 <https://ams.com/tsl45315>`_. VEML6075 on the SL01 is capable of measuring UVA and UVB radiation, in turn, providing an acccurate UV Index. TSL4531 is a light sensor that is capable of measuring the luminosity (Wide Dynamic Range — 3 lux to 220k lux) (visual brightness).

Please note, SL01 and all other xChips is currently only supported in Zerynth Studio with `XinaBox CW02 <https://docs.zerynth.com/latest/official/board.zerynth.xinabox_esp32/docs/index.html>`_. Review the `Quick Start <https://wiki.xinabox.cc/Quick-Start>`_ guide for interfacing xChips.
